# Hangman-Game

Welcome to the Hawaiian hangman game! And thanks for reading the readme!

The rules are fairly simple: 

1) Start typing to guess the word (hint: all possible words are Hawaiian-esque)
2) You have 10 lives (letter guesses) per round 
3) Guess the correct letters before you run out of lives? Congrats! You win
4) Run out of lives before guessing the magic word? Sorry! You lose
3) Have fun? Play again!
